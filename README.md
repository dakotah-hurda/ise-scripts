# ISE Scripts
This repository is meant to house all scripts related to interacting with the Cisco ISE API. 

Utility scripts that perform a specific, common action are uploaded under utils/

Scripts that are used to perform specific administrative tasks are uploaded in directories that describe their function. For example, cityworks-ipads/ houses scripts that deal with managing our Cityworks iPads profiling on ISE.
